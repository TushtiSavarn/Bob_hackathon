## Personalized Banking App with Azure

# Overview
This project showcases how Azure can empower the personalization of a banking app using customer data and AI models. Leveraging transaction and interaction data, the app uses Azure to understand user needs, personalize content such as offers and reports, and provide 24/7 support via an AI chatbot. The app is designed with an accessible UI/UX to cater to all users.

# Features
-**Personalized Content:** AI models analyze customer data to personalize content, such as tailored offers and financial reports.
-**AI Chatbot:** A chatbot provides 24/7 support, assisting users with queries and issues.
-**Accessible UI/UX:** The user interface is designed to be accessible to all users, ensuring a seamless experience for everyone.
  
# Tech Stack
-**Programming Language:** Python
-**Machine Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch
-**Database:** Azure Cosmos DB
-**Machine Learning Service:** Azure Machine Learning

# How We Will Build the Prototype
**1. Data Collection and Storage**
Azure Cosmos DB: Store transaction and interaction data securely in Azure Cosmos DB. This database service provides globally distributed, multi-model database capabilities for scalable and high-performance data storage.
**2. Data Analysis and Model Training**
Azure Machine Learning: Utilize Azure Machine Learning to create and manage machine learning workflows. Train AI models on the customer data to predict user needs and personalize content.
TensorFlow/PyTorch: Use these frameworks for developing and training deep learning models. They offer extensive libraries and tools for building robust AI models.
**3. Integration of AI Models**
Integrate the trained AI models into the banking app to personalize content such as offers and financial reports.
Ensure models are regularly updated with new data to maintain personalization accuracy.
**4. Development of AI Chatbot**
Develop an AI chatbot using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to provide 24/7 support.
Integrate the chatbot with the app, enabling it to handle user queries and provide assistance in real-time.
**5. Building an Accessible UI/UX**
Design a user interface that is accessible and easy to navigate.
Ensure the UI/UX complies with accessibility standards to cater to all users, including those with disabilities.

# Conclusion
By leveraging Azure's powerful tools and services, this project aims to create a highly personalized and accessible banking experience. The integration of AI models and an AI chatbot ensures users receive tailored content and 24/7 support, enhancing overall user satisfaction.
